### Master's Dissertation (Thesis)
Comparative Analysis of Supervised Learning Methods for Fake News Detection<br>
Supervisor : [Dr. Alan Godfrey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AUptNgUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)  
Abstract :
>Fake news detection is a challenging problem, and there are many different artificial
>intelligence approaches developed to detect fake news. However, it is still unclear
>which approach is better and where further research should lead. To accomplish this
>goal, we conducted this study to compare the existing supervised learning methods for
>classifying fake news. We conducted our study on ‘Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire’ dataset with
>12.8K columns. We implemented NLP technique TF-IDF and evaluated the performance
>of seven machine learning algorithms i.e., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes,
>XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and LinearSVC and six
>deep learning methods namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural
>Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated
>Recurrent Units (GRU) and Bi-Directional LSTM. Our results reveal that machine
>learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM and deep learning
>methods like LSTM and GRU are the most efficient for fake news detection task, whereas
>Decision Tree, LinearSVC, Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network are least
>efficient. We have also presented evaluation of our implementation and model
>performance. Finally, we discussed how the fake news detection problem can be
>approached in future for better results.
