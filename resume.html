Abstract :<br>
<blockquote>Fake news detection is a challenging problem, and there are many different artificial
intelligence approaches developed to detect fake news. However, it is still unclear
which approach is better and where further research should lead. To accomplish this
goal, we conducted this study to compare the existing supervised learning methods for
classifying fake news. We conducted our study on ‘Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire’ dataset with
12.8K columns. We implemented NLP technique TF-IDF and evaluated the performance
of seven machine learning algorithms i.e., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes,
XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and LinearSVC and six
deep learning methods namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU) and Bi-Directional LSTM. Our results reveal that machine
learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM and deep learning
methods like LSTM and GRU are the most efficient for fake news detection task, whereas
Decision Tree, LinearSVC, Artificial Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network are least
efficient. We have also presented evaluation of our implementation and model
performance. Finally, we discussed how the fake news detection problem can be
approached in future for better results.
